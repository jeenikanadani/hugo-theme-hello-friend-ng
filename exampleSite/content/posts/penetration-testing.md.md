Greetings Hackers,  
It is very essential to understand the main reason and intention of a Hacker. A hacker with good intentions are Penetration Testers or Bug Bounty Hunters. But a hacker with bad intention is a Cyber Criminal.

##  What is Penetration Testing?
Penetration Testing is answering a simple question: “What would a cybercriminal do to harm my organisation’ computer systems, applications, and network?“. It is the practice of testing a computer system, network or web application to nd vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit, simulating an attack against an organisation’s IT assets. Penetration testing can involve the attempted breaching of any number of application systems to uncover vulnerabilities. Penetration Testing is is designed to check your security before an attacker does. Vulnerabilities can happen due to multiple reasons.

## 5 important stages that are involved during a Penetration Testing

#### 1. Planning and reconnaissance: 
This stage involves understanding the scope and the goal of the test. The attacker gathers as much information about the target as possible. The data can be IP addresses, domain details, mail servers etc. An expert will spend most of the time in this phase. As this phase will help more in the further stages of the testing.

#### 2. Scanning: 
The attacker will interact with the target with an aim to identify the vulnerabilities. Scanning can be either static or dynamic. In Static it is inspecting an application’s code to understand the way it behaves while running. In Dynamic it is inspecting an application’s code in a running state. This is a more practical way of scanning, as it provides a real-time view into an application’s performance.

#### 3. Gaining Access: 
This is the step where the actual damage is done. In this stage different types of attacks are used to uncover a target’s vulnerabilities.Testers then go and exploit these vulnerabilities to understand the damage they can cause.

#### 4. Risk Analysis & Recommendations: 
In this stage the goal is to collect the evidence of the exploited vulnerabilities. This mostly considers an evaluation of the vulnerabilities present in the form of potential risks. Sometimes, the tester also provides some useful recommendations to implement in order to improve security levels if asked.

#### 5. Report Generation:
Now, this is the nal and the most important step. In this step, the results of the penetration test are assembled into a detailed report.

## Types Of Penetration Testing:

**Black Box **: Attacker has zero knowledge of the target.  

** White Box **: Attacker has given complete knowledge of the target. 

** Grey Box **: Attacker has partial knowledge of the target.
