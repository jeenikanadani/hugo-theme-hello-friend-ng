Bonjour Hackers,

Being in InfoSec it is extremely necessary to have good knowledge of some key elements. Let’s check them one by one.

## What is HACK ?

Hacking basically is to gain illegal access to it can be a computer system, computer network, etc.

Hack in the context of Computer Security, it basically means performing actions on a computer system in an unapproved way.

Often computer hacking largely goes unreported. Large organisations may not readily admit that their secure computer networks have been hacked.

While the term hack has meant different things over time, it almost always has a negative undertone from the perspective of a non-techie person. This is despite the actuality that many hackers aren’t in it to do anything mischievous. Some hack for the fun and challenge of it, while others do it in a skilful form to assist organisations improve their IT security.

## What is HACKING ?

Hacking is analysing weakness in computer systems or networks to exploit its weaknesses to gain access.

Hacking is an attempt to exploit a computer system or a private network inside a computer. Simply it is the unauthorised access to/ control over computer network security systems for some unlawful purpose.

To better describe hacking, one needs to first understand hackers. One can easily assume them to be intelligent and highly skilled in computers. In fact, breaking a security system requires more intelligence and expertise than actually creating one.


## Who is a HACKER ?

A Hacker is a person who finds and exploits the weakness in computer systems and/or networks to gain access. Hackers are usually skilled computer programmers with knowledge of computer security.


### Types of HACKERS:

** Ethical Hacker (White hat) ** : A hacker who gains access to systems with an end to fix the identified weaknesses. They may also perform penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.

  
** Cracker (Black hat) **: A hacker who gains unauthorised access to computer systems for personal gain. His/Her intention is basically to abduct corporate data, breach privacy rights, transfer funds from bank accounts etc.

  
** Grey hat **: A hacker who is in between ethical and black hat hackers. He/she breaks into computer systems without permission with an end to identify weaknesses and expose them to the system owner.

  
** Script kiddies **: A non-skilled person who gains access to computer systems using already made tools.

  
** Hacktivist **: A hacker who use hacking to send social, religious, and political, etc. messages. This is usually done by hijacking websites and leaving the message on the hijacked website. Phreaker: A hacker who identifies and exploits weaknesses in telephones instead of computers.
